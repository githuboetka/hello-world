you may NEVER make code changes in braches of github.
Only ONE person masters the master version. Never it is
possible to make changes in 2 branches at the same time,
because a dead lock in code changes is possible!!
So EVER only use github with 1 person at a time for 1
codeproject!!
You can theoretically proove that a merge is not always possible:
in case of the dead lock:
simple example:
person 1 changes first class A and then B
person 2 changes first class B and then A
Merging gives now a dead lock!
